Command Line Usage
==================

This provides information on command line usage of Docvert, as provided by PHP CLI.

	Note: for errors also see trouble-shooting.txt

Linux / OSX / BSD
=================
PHP CLI may not be included with the conventional Web interface. See your operating
system's package manager for a "PHP CLI" package.

Also your PHP may have a seperate php.ini file for command line use, and this
php.ini may not have XSLT or other extensions enabled. In some systems they may be
under /etc/php/cli/php.ini .

The files in Docvert's "bin" directory are the scripts and they should be set as
executable. For Linux, only use the scripts without filename extensions (the .php
scripts are instead for Windows use).

All of these extension-less scripts are identical (duplicates just so that you may
type odt2xml or odf2hml and it'll work).

From the command line call one of these scripts without any parameters/flags to
receive usage information, and diagnostics.

	Note: if you receive an error about being unable to find your PHP, then
	type "which php" at the command line and update the scripts to point at
	the given location. Eg., replace (#!/path/to/php -q) with the results of
	the "which" command.

Windows
=======
Here are some instructions on how to make PHP files executable from the command prompt in Windows.

There is an environment variable (control panel->system->advanced->environment variables) named
PATHEXT. This contains a list of extensions that you may execute from the command line, so
add .php and .PHP to this list.

PHP's default application will now be run, so we need to make the PHP command line executable
the default application. First, we have to find it (although typically this is "php.exe"):

	Open Windows File Explorer and go to your PHP directory. Hover the mouse pointer over
	the executables until - in an info bubble - the word "CLI" is shown.

Once we've found it we need to set up a default action,

	To set up the default action:
	Open Explorer.
	Go to Tools->folder options->file types
	Find the extension you're looking for.  If it's not there, click New to add it.
	Click on the file type, then on Advanced, then New.
	For the action, type "Run" or "Execute" or whatever makes sense.
	For the application, type

		  "c:\program files\php\php.exe" %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

	Where the path to php points at your PHP command-line executable.

It's now done. Use cmd.exe (not command.com) to open up a command line prompt, and then
go to the "bin" directory and run any script with .php at the end (these .php scripts are
all identical). Call the script to receive usage information, and diagnostics.
