WMF/EMF to SVG/PNG
==================

By default Docvert uses the Debian tool "wmf2svg" or "wmf2gd" but these haven't
been updated since 2005 (there have been security releases since then but
there are no new features).

If you find that those don't support WMF/EMF files adequately then try "wmftosvg",

 http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/wmftosvg.zip (Source. Compiles on Windows/Ubuntu)
 http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/wmftosvg.txt (Readme)
 http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/wmftosvg.exe (Windows)

Read its documentation, try some WMF files, and you'll see that it's
considerably better at WMF/EMF than "wmf2svg".

After installing "wmftosvg" you can tell Docvert to use it by changing the
appropriate scripts in the config directory,

 /core/config/[OPERATING SYSTEM]

Edit "convert-using-wmf2svg.sh" or "convert-using-wmf2svg.bat" to point at
your install of wmftosvg. Then edit the equivalent "convert-using-wmf2gd.sh"
or "convert-using-wmf2gd.bat" files with 'svg to png' utilities such as
rsvg.
