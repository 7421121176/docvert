I get a "Parse error, unexpected T_STRING" about "webpage.php"
--------------------------------------------------------------
	If the error looks like,

		Parse error: parse error, unexpected T_STRING, expecting 
		T_OLD_FUNCTION or T_FUNCTION or T_VAR or '}' in
		 /xxx/docvert/core/webpage.php on line 18

	Then that means you're probably running PHP4.

	Docvert needs PHP5, see the install.txt file for all install
	requirements.

Docvert or OpenOffice.org freezes
---------------------------------

	Check the process list to see if OpenOffice.org (OOo) is running,
	if so it's likely that OOo is stuck in a dialog window that
	needs clicking.

		In *nix try killing OOo (and perhaps Xvfb too)... find
		processes named "soffice".

		Once this is done go to the admin page and click on
		"Setup OpenOffice.org" to bring up the word processor.
		Make sure it hasn't stalled.

		In Windows it's a similar process of seeing what OOo is
		doing. So kill the process, and if your web server is
		installed as a Window Service ensure that - as in Step
		2 of the installation notes (above) - the service can
		interact with the desktop. Now from the admin page run
		Docvert and OOo should pop up for you to have a look at.

	When you've got OpenOffice.org up make sure it starts without
	any dialogs.
	

Internal PHP error message
--------------------------

	Due to an apparent bug in the pclzip library that Docvert uses
	you may see a PHP "notice" level error, typically supressed by
	most configurations of PHP...
	
	"Undefined index: filename_len in /var/www/pclzip-2-3/
	pclzip.lib.php on line 3949"

	There's no fix from the pclzip authors at the moment. In the meantime
	change the PHP error reporting level to supress "notice" level errors
	by changing php.ini to read,

	error_reporting  =  E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE



Sudo keeps asking for password but it has permissions, I set it via visudo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Try setting all the scripts in ~/config/ as executable (Eg, chmod)



OpenOffice.org reports "Error in function createUserSettingsDocument (elements.cxx)"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	OpenOffice.org is complaining that it's unable to save a user settings
	file, so make sure OpenOffice.org is running as a user that can write to
	their home directory. Make sure that the HOME environment variable is set
	appropriately in convert-using-openoffice.org.sh. Typically you'll be
	running as the root user.


OpenOffice.org keeps giving me macro warnings even though I've told it to trust macros
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	OpenOffice.org was unable to remember your configuration because it couldn't
	save a config file. It may be that the user OpenOffice.org is running as
	doesn't have write access to its home directory.

	The home directory for your web-server user will probably be "/var/www"
	(on an Ubuntu system) so you'll need to	give it write access. When it does
	have write access it will make a ~/.openoffice.org2 directory.

		(security conscious people might want to make that
		"~/.openoffice.org2" directory for OOo, and only give it
		write access to that)

	NOTE: Be sure that you're starting OOo from the admin page so OOo will open
	as the correct user, and save it's config to the this users' home directory.
	Opening OOo from your desktop will open OOo as your user, not as your
	web-server user.


Start tag expected, '<' not found in [...]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This error message means that the processor tried to read your XML
	but it was empty.

	The cause of this problem will vary, but try to figure out what's responsible
	for providing you with an empty document (Eg, you'll need understand how your
	XML was generated). Something in this process is broken, and it's handing an
	empty document to your XML or XSLT processor.

	In Docvert this is typically caused by a bad bit of XSLT. Add a "debug" stage
	to your pipeline just before the error to see what the contents are,

		<stage process="Debug"/>

	Move the debug stage around the pipeline until you can identify the process
	that's causing the problem.

	Have a go at fixing it yourself, but otherwise post on the mailing list about it
	with a good description and include a link to a download of the pipeline to help
	us diagnose the problem.

	Any tips on what customisations you made to the XSLT would be useful too.


I get a "sudo: unable to execute [...] No such file or directory" but the file is there
OR
I get an error saying /bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	First make sure the file is there.

	Then, if you're on Linux/Mac, see if the file is set as exectuable.

	Finally, there are different linebreak characters on DOS vs Unix/Mac.
	It's possible that DOS characters have made it into your text file, so try
	removing them.


Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded in....
-----------------------------------------------------------------

	PHP has a time limit for script completion. You can increase this in php.ini.
	There are a few reasons for this,
	
	1) Docvert usually works for you but this time you uploaded a big document
	and Docvert wasn't able to complete processing in the alloted time.

		Solution

			Change your "max-execution-time" in php.ini to a longer
			time, Find the line that reads,

			max_execution_time = 30

			And increase the value.	It's not unheard of to need 120
			seconds or more of execution time.

				See also,
				http://tinyurl.com/yzynmj
			
			To activate the changes restart Apache (or your webserver)

	2) Docvert hasn't worked for you yet or it doesn't work on small documents.
	This is probably due to some external software (like OpenOffice.org) hanging
	which will cause Docvert to stall and exceed the maximum execution time (which
	means the time Docvert is allowed to run for).
	
		Solution

			You should solve this problem by figuring out what caused
			OpenOffice.org to hang. Try starting OpenOffice.org from the
			admin page (as you did when you installed Docvert) and see
			whether there are any dialog windows open that need clicking.

	3) You've discovered a bug in Docvert.

		Solution

			Well there's no immediate fix, it could be anything,
			Mention it on the mailing list and include these details:

				- The version number of Docvert, PHP, Apache.
				- The operating system (Windows? Linux? Which version)
				- The document you were trying to convert
				- Anything else you think might be useful.
			

I forgot my admin password
--------------------------

	View the writable/adminpassword.php file (feel free to edit this file directly)
	or delete it.

	Please note that if you delete this file then the first person to choose a new
	password via the admin page will be able to do so.


When I use command line Docvert it says I don't have XSLT, but I do
-------------------------------------------------------------------
	There's two scenarios I know of, the first much more likely than the second.

	1. Command line PHP may have its own PHP.ini file.

		Step 1) Find your PHP.ini file,

			Linux/Unix: check under /etc/php5/cli/php.ini
			Windows: unknown.. just search for php.ini
		Step 2)
			Find the file and reenable XSL.

			This is usually done by adding a line that reads,
				extension=xsl.so

	2. It may be the the user you're running as is not allowed to access the XSLT
	extension (the command line error message should have told you this).
	Try running it as root, or as the web-server user to initially diagnose
	whether permissions are the problem.
	Then it's up to you whether it's worth changing permissions on the XSLT
	extension, or whether running conversions as that user it acceptable.


Allowed memory size of X bytes exhausted
----------------------------------------

	Due to a large document you uploaded Docvert needed a lot of memory.
	Unfortunately it needed more memory than was allowed by PHP. So,

	Step 1.	Change your "memory_limit" in php.ini to a larger value.
		Find the line that reads,

		memory_limit = 8M

		And increase the value.

	Step 2.	Restart Apache (or your webserver)


documentPath contains bad characters
------------------------------------

	This is probably a bug in Docvert, so send the exact error message to the
	mailing list or docvert@holloway.co.nz. We need to know the exact error
	message because this error message is about Docvert's security rejecting
	the filename of the file you uploaded.


I tried to view documentation in "/doc" from the web interface but it's there's
an error that it's not found
    OR
I can't download the sample documents.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	See if Apache is configured to server the alias "/doc" to another
	directory.

xauth or xvfb errors
--------------------
If you dont't have xauth installed try installing 'xbase-clients'.

xvfb errors are inherently difficult to debug because it's a fake X-server and so
no one can see what's going on. xvfb is only used by OpenOffice.org, so if you find
yourself struggling with xvfb then instead try using Abiword (not a good solution,
granted, but I thought it was worth saying). Do be sure to get a recent version of
Abiword because their OpenDocument support improved a lot recently, and version
2.6.3 is quite good).
