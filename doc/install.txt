*	PHP 5 or later, with the "ZLIB" and "XSL" extensions.



Optional Libraries
-------------------------------------------------------------
*	If you want to convert Microsoft Word documents then
	you'll need to choose a 'Microsoft Word to OpenDocument'
	converter, which is one of these...

	*	OpenOffice.org 1.9.122 or later.
		The more current your version of OpenOffice.org
		the more likely it'll be compatible with the
		vagaries of the MS Word format - so keep your
		OOo current.

		On Linux/BSD/OSX you'll also need "Xvfb".

		Accelerated OpenOffice.org conversions are supported
		thanks to the fantastic work in PyODConverter.

	*	Abiword 2.4.2 or later.


*	If you want to convert bitmap images like BMP, JPG,
	PNG, GIF you'll need PHP GD.

*	If your documents files have diagrams or graphs in WMF
	(windows metafile format) and you want to convert
	them to PNG/JPEG/SVG then you'll need to install
	"libwmf".
	Windows,
	  http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libwmf.htm
	  and grab "Complete package, except sources"
	Linux,
	  your distribution's packaging, and find
		libwmf0.2-7 or later,
		libwmf-bin
	  - http://wvware.sourceforge.net/libwmf.html

*	If you want to validate documents against a schema
	you'll need
	Linux:
		Trang from your distro's package manager or
		<http://thaiopensource.com/relaxng/trang.html>
	Windows:
		...I don't know. If you could suggest a good
		schema validator with command line support
		I'll support it.

*	If your documents have SVG images and you want to
	convert them to PNG/JPEG/GIF, then you'll need to
	install "svgrlib".
	Windows,
	  http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html
	Linux,
	  your distribution's packaging, and find
		librsvg2-2
		librsvg-bin
	  http://librsvg.sourceforge.net/download/

*	If you're using "Document Generation" you'll need PHP-Tidy
	(HTMLTidy).

Install + Security
=============================================================

Step 1.	Host the Docvert software on a web server.

Step 2.	Ensure that /writable is writable.

	And,
		Linux/OSX Users:
			Ensure that /etc/docvert is
			writable.

		Windows Users:
			Ensure that
			/core/config/windows-specific/config/
			is writable.

			Ensure that this directory is not
			browsable from the web. Verify that
			it's not by browsing to this
			directory in your web browser
			Eg. it could be at
			http://localhost/docvert/core/config/windows-specific/config/

	Now secure Docvert's admin page by opening up
	Docvert in your web browser and browse to
	the admin page (the tab on the top-right).

	On the admin page, set the password.

Step 3. Do you want to convert Word Documents or just
	OpenDocument files?

	If you just want to convert OpenDocument files then
	go to Step 4.

	If you do want to convert Microsoft Word files (or
	from other formats), then continue reading...

	You'll need to choose a 'Microsoft Word to OpenDocument'
	converter. You have the choice of,
		* PyODConverter with OpenOffice.org
		* Standalone OpenOffice.org
		* JODConverter with OpenOffice.org
		* Abiword

	If you're just trialing Docvert then
	"Standalone OpenOffice.org" is the easiest option to set up.

	However if you've been using Docvert for a while then I recommend the
	"PyODConverter with OpenOffice.org" option.

	Choose now!


	PyODConverter with OpenOffice
	-----------------------------
	
		PyODConverter requires Python and OpenOffice.org to
		be running in server mode (listening on a port).

		Docvert includes its own copy of PyODConverter so there's
		no need to download a copy, but you'll need to configure
		OpenOffice.org to be listening on a port.

		See http://www.artofsolving.com/opensource/pyodconverter
		for how to configure OpenOffice.org to do this, however,
		it can be as simple as running,

			Unix
			soffice -accept="socket,port=8100;urp;"

			Windows
			soffice.exe -accept="socket,port=8100;urp;"


	Standalone OpenOffice.org 
	---------------------------------------------------------------

		Stage i)
			Windows:
				In "core/config/windows-specific" edit
				these files,
					"convert-using-openoffice.org.bat"

			Linux/OSX:
				In "core/config/unix-specific" edit
				these files,
					"convert-using-openoffice.org.sh"

			...to point at the OpenOffice.org executable
			(typically "oowriter" or "oowriter2").

				For Linux/OSX users you'll need to allow
				your web-server user to run this script
				so go to the admin page and under the
				"Run as User" heading enter the username
				to run OpenOffice.org as (by default it
				will run as root), then you'll need to
				configure permissions with the "visudo"
				command to add some lines to sudoers,

				Add these lines (read below for which
				bits to edit)

	www-data ALL=(NAMEOFUSER) NOPASSWD: /var/www/docvert/core/config/unix-specific/convert-using-openoffice.org.sh
	www-data ALL=(NAMEOFUSER) NOPASSWD: /var/www/docvert/core/config/unix-specific/validate-against-schema.sh
	www-data ALL=(NAMEOFUSER) NOPASSWD: /var/www/docvert/core/config/unix-specific/convert-using-abiword.sh

				/var/www/vhosts[...].sh are the paths to your
				scripts. In the case of Abiword, point to Abiword
				instead.
				Replace NAMEOFUSER with.. the name of the user but
				leave the brackets () because sudoers wants them.
				And replace www-data with the web server user if it's
				something else.

				Note: As a security measure it's a good idea to
				ensure that the webserver user cannot edit this file
				and change it to run any command with root privledges.
				Do this by removing write permissions for all files
				under the "core/config/unix-specific" directory.

		Stage ii)

			In OpenOffice.org we'll need to tell it to trust Docvert's
			macros. We do this by adding "core/config/trusted-macros"
			to the list of trusted macros within OpenOffice.org.

			Open up Docvert in your web browser and browse to the Admin
			page (there's a tab on the top right). If it's complaining
			about the "/writable" directory not being writable then
			make that directory writable, create an admin password.

			Now get on the same computer as the web server.

				If you've got your Web Server as a Windows Service
				it may be supress OOo from appearing so go to
				Windows Services and the properties window for your
				web server program. Go to the "Log On" tab, ensuring
				that "Allow service to interact with desktop" is
				ticked and then restart the service.
				(Later, if you want to supress OOo from appearing
				during conversions, as you probably do, then untick
				that checkbox and then restart the service.)

			Now click the "Setup OpenOffice.org" button on the admin page
			to start OpenOffice.org.

				If there are problems here check Step 2 again, and
				follow the instructions on screen which will try
				and detect common configuration mistakes. Also try
				the troubleshooting.txt	guide.
				You'll need to be able to start OpenOffice.org before
				continuing.

			Once you've got OpenOffice.org started go to TOOLS | OPTIONS
			| SECURITY and "macro security". Add the directory
			"core/config/trusted-macros" to the trusted list.

			Exit OpenOffice.org and test that it's worked by clicking
			on "Setup OpenOffice.org" again. Ensure there are no dialog
			windows that appear when doing this.

			If there are still dialog windows and you think you've followed
			Stage ii correctly then read the troubleshooting.txt file, or
			post on the Docvert mailing list.


	JODConverter with OpenOffice
	----------------------------
	
		JODConverter requires Java and OpenOffice.org to
		be running in server mode (listening on a port).

		Docvert DOES NOT include its own copy of JODConverter
		so you'll need to download it and put it in

			core/lib/jodconverter

		Then you'll need to configure OpenOffice.org to be
		listening on a port.

		See http://www.artofsolving.com/opensource/jodconverter
		for how to configure OpenOffice.org to do this, however,
		it can be as simple as running,

			Unix
			soffice -accept="socket,port=8100;urp;"

			Windows
			soffice.exe -accept="socket,port=8100;urp;"


	Abiword
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Edit the core/config Abiword file for...
			Linux/OSX:
				In "core/config/unix-specific" edit
				this file,
					"convert-using-abiword.sh"
			Windows:
				In "core/config/windows-specific" edit
				this file,
					"convert-using-abiword.bat"

Step 4.	That's it.

	...well that's enough to convert, but there are additional
	features you can set up too such as,

	All of these involve editing the appropriate files under
	"/core/config" to point at conversion libraries.
	
	Schema Validation
	-----------------
		And if you want Schema Validation then edit,
			Linux/OSX,
				"validate-against-schema.sh"
			Windows,
				"validate-against-schema.bat"
		...to point to Trang.


	Image Conversion
	----------------
		Edit these...
			Linux/OSX,
				"convert-using-wmf2gd.sh"
				"convert-using-wmf2svg.sh"
			Windows,
				"convert-using-wmf2gd.bat"
				"convert-using-wmf2svg.bat"
