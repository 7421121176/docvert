Docvert Word Plugin
===================
This installs a toolbar in Microsoft Word '97 and up. It allows an office of
people to share a single Docvert Server. See the Docvert homepage for
screenshots.


Supported Platforms
====================
Only available on the Windows version of Microsoft Office right now.

Mac support isn't being developed but yeah if you want to develop it and stuff.

OpenOffice.org (any platform) isn't supported either.


Requirements
============
A Docvert server that supports MSWord uploads (eg, a Docvert server with
OpenOffice.org or Abiword)


Installation
============

	1.	Run the .exe in ~/wordplugins/ 
	2.	Open c:\windows\docvert.ini and edit the file to point at the URL
		 of the Docvert server. Include a trailing slash ("/")


Programmers wanting to customise the installer
==============================================
The installer is built in NSIS, so

	1.	Download the installer framework "NSIS" from nsis.sf.net
	2.	In wordplugin/sources edit the docvert.ini to point at your
		Docvert server.
	3.	Compile the NSIS script to produce a .exe.
